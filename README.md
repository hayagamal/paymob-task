# React + TypeScript + Vite

This app is a dynamic table component built with React and TypeScript, designed to display structured data with customizable headers and formatting. It supports:

✅ Dynamic Data Rendering – Displays data records based on a configurable headersConfig.<br>
✅ Custom Formatting – Uses a factory pattern to format currency dynamically (EGP, USD, etc.), and applies date formatting. using factory pattern keeps logic modular and extensible—if more currencies need support, you just update the factory.
<br>
✅ Styled Components – Uses styled-components for a polished, responsive UI.<br>
✅ Flexible & Extendable – Allows easy integration with different datasets by modifying headersConfig.<br>
✅ Use CSS variables - to enable consistent theming, easy customization, and dynamic styling across table component without modifying individual styles.<br>
✅ Using Ant Design for features like sorting provides a quick, consistent, and customizable solution with pre-built components, reducing development time and ensuring a polished user experience.
